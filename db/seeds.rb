message = %Q{My thoughts after yesterday. This will be my one and only post about these terrible circumstances we have allowed to happen. Our founding fathers must be rolling over in their graves and heart broken at what we have done and allowed to be done to our country.
Gay marriage being legalized in some states, tax payer funded abortions allowed in others,and this man for president who has done nothing to better the lives of most of the "average" Americans.
Barak Obama has an Islamic/Communist worldview and is actively working to bring the sovereignty of the United States under the control of the United Nations. He is anti-Christian, anti-American, Anti-Constitutional and anti-life. These facts are indisputable whether or not people want to acknowledge them. It is blind Americans that can't see him for what he really is, a revolutionary who is destroying the sovereignty of the United States. In a very short time, people will not recognize this country, but don't say we didn't try to tell you.
But hey, it's a great idea to give this man 4 more years to destroy our country?!? Goodbye America as we've known it. I will now be telling my children and grandchildren about when America was a strong, Christian, free, leading, and more morally sound nation. Sadly, they will not know these by seeing for themselves.}
